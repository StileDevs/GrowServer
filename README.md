> A Growtopia private server using Node.js

## Requirements

- Node.js v18+ (Recommended LTS v20)
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

## Setup

To setup the server, first install necessary packages & settings by

```
$ npm install
```

And congrats setup are done, simple as that!
Now you just need to run the server by

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Enviroment file

Example for default .env file (Generated automatically)

```
ENCRYPT_SECRET=SUPERSECRET # Default encrypt secret
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=Tokxxxxxxxen
```

## Database

Database that we currently use is SQLite, since its easier & light instead of using JSON.
And for the ORM we are using [Drizzle-ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)

To view the database you can run this command below:

```
$ npm run studio
```

and access it on here https://local.drizzle.studio/

## Starting server

To run the development server by

```
$ npm run start
```

## Development

In order to make new login system work you need to install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) on this [download page](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases) (I'd recommend using [Lets encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) for production only)

### Local CA installation

Install the mkcert local CA by

```
$ npm run mkcert:setup
```

### Hosts

For the hosts file you can see this example below

```
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia1.com
127.0.0.1 www.growtopia2.com
127.0.0.1 login.growserver.app # New login system for development purposes
```
